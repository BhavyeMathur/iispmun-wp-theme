    <p style="text-align: justify">Unlike any other, this past year has seen constant turmoil. Protests in Iran, the invasion of Ukraine, and political upheaval all around the world, all occurring in parallel, have thrown virtually every “normal” system, as we know it, into chaos. At the other end of chaos, however, is transformation; systems, once thrown into disarray, bring themselves to a new equilibrium, and arguably a better one. Our IISP MUN theme for 2023, Rising from the Ashes, encapsulates the incredible human instinct to persist; the ability to constantly reinvent itself and emerge as a better form of what previously existed.

<p style="text-align: justify">At IISP MUN 2023, we will see delegates from across India tackling problems from all over the world with bold ideas and tough stances, tempered with geopolitical awareness and diplomatic communication. The world’s problems are uncountable and many-layered, but with collaborative effort, we believe that a better and brighter future is within our reach.
